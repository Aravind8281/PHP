### 1. Output Escaping:

Always escape output to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Smarty provides the `escape` modifier for this purpose.

```smarty
{$userInput|escape}
```

### 2. Trusted Data:

Be cautious when displaying user input. Avoid directly outputting untrusted data, especially if it comes from user inputs, without proper validation and sanitization.

### 3. Disable PHP Tags:

By default, Smarty doesn't allow the execution of PHP code within templates. However, it's good practice to explicitly disable PHP tags to prevent any potential security risks.

```smarty
{* Disable PHP tags in templates *}
{$smarty.block.allow_php = false}
```

### 4. Limit Template Includes:

Limit the use of `{include}` to trusted templates. Avoid dynamic includes based on user input to prevent template injection.

```smarty
{* Good: Hard-coded include *}
{include file="header.tpl"}

{* Avoid: Dynamic include based on user input *}
{include file=$userInputTemplate}
```

### 5. Secure Your Cache Directory:

Ensure that the directory used for caching is secure and not accessible directly from the web. Set appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access.

### 6. Keep Smarty Up-to-Date:

Regularly update Smarty to the latest version to benefit from security fixes and improvements.

### 7. Validate Input Data:

Before passing user input to Smarty templates, validate and sanitize the data. This helps prevent unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.

### 8. Context-Aware Escaping:

Be aware of the context in which output is being used and apply appropriate escaping. For example, HTML escaping might be different from URL or JavaScript escaping.

### 9. Review and Audit Templates:

Regularly review and audit your templates for security vulnerabilities. Look for potential injection points and validate the usage of dynamic values.

### 10. Disable Smarty Debugging in Production:

Smarty provides debugging features that can expose sensitive information. Ensure that debugging is disabled in the production environment.

```php
<?php
$smarty->debugging = false;
```

### 11. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):

Consider implementing Content Security Policy headers to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks.

### 12. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:

If your application uses forms, implement CSRF protection mechanisms to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
